## 📋 Overview

A cutting-edge implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leveraging graph-based approaches. This project showcases innovative methods for enhancing information retrieval and generation through structured graph relationships.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Advanced Retrieval**: Sophisticated graph-based search algorithms
- 🧠 **Smart Context**: Enhanced understanding through graph relationships
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and accuracy
- 📈 **Scalability**: Designed for large-scale knowledge bases
- 🛠️ **Multiple Implementations**: Different approaches for various use cases

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Its always advisable to install it in your conda/virtual env
2️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please install Ollama and then pull Qwen-coder latest using it.
To test your local qwen, there exists a simple python script - testQwenconnect
kmgraph_builder.py, will first test the access to neo4j. What's important is that after creating a database of your choice in neo4j, please install the APOC plugin
Review the code for kmgraph_builder.py, its documented well. 
Thereafter you can run it.
