## 📋 Overview

A cutting-edge implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leveraging graph-based approaches. This project showcases innovative methods for enhancing information retrieval and generation through structured graph relationships.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Advanced Retrieval**: Sophisticated graph-based search algorithms
- 🧠 **Smart Context**: Enhanced understanding through graph relationships
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and accuracy
- 📈 **Scalability**: Designed for large-scale knowledge bases
- 🛠️ **Multiple Implementations**: Different approaches for various use cases

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Its always advisable to install it in your conda/virtual env
2️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please install Ollama and then pull Qwen-coder latest using it.
To test your local qwen, there exists a simple python script - testQwenconnect
kmgraph_builder.py, will first test the access to neo4j. What's important is that after creating a database of your choice in neo4j, please install the APOC plugin
Review the code for kmgraph_builder.py, its documented well. 
Thereafter you can run it. 

clusterSimilarMovies.py picks-up from where the RAG has completed its job. This script extracts, movie title, its plot and genre from Neo4J and then calls Qwen
to extract their embedding. The embeddings are stored back into neo4j for each movie. Thereafter kmeans is used to cluster similar movies together. The code is documented well.
